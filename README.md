## Blinkit Sales Analysis: A Data Exploration with Power BI
This project utilized Power BI to comprehensively analyze Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. The goal was to identify key trends and opportunities for optimization.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Total Sales:
Overall revenue generated.
Average Sales: 
Average revenue per order.
Number of Items: 
Total count of different items sold.
Average Rating:
Average customer rating for products.
## Data Visualization and Insights:

Impact of Fat Content: A donut chart explored how total sales relate to the fat content of items. Additional KPIs like average sales and customer ratings were analyzed within this context to gain a deeper understanding.
Performance by Item Type: A bar chart compared total sales across different item types (e.g., groceries, snacks, beverages). Similar to the fat content analysis, we examined how other KPIs varied by item type.
Outlet Performance: Stacked column charts visualized total sales across outlets, segmented by fat content. This allowed for comparisons between outlets while considering product variations.
Outlet Analysis: We further investigated sales trends based on factors like outlet establishment (age/type) and size (through pie charts).
Geographic Distribution: A funnel map provided insights into the geographic distribution of sales across different locations.
Outlet Type Breakdown: A matrix card offered a comprehensive view of all KPIs (total sales, average sales, number of items, average rating) for various outlet types.
Overall, this Power BI project provided valuable insights into Blinkit's sales landscape. By analyzing these factors, Blinkit can potentially optimize product offerings, target specific customer segments, and improve overall sales performance.
